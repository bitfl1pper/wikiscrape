# wikiscrape

This is a simple text scraper for wikipedia. Please be a nice person and don't use this if you are planning on doing heavy scraping. I'd imagine they'd rather you use the API.
The core namespace contains a bare bones implementation of a naive text scraper (mostly resting upon the shoulders of the Enlive Clojure library [TODO: insert repo link])

It also contains a simple script of an example usage.
